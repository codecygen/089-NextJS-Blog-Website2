## 1.1 Optimization and Deployment Steps for Next.js

### 1.1.1 Manual Optimization
- Add page metadata, optimize code, remove unnecessary dependencies.
- Use environment variables for data (e.g database credentials, API keys etc.). For environmental variables, the data can either be stored in **.env.local** or **next.config.js**.

### 1.1.2 Testing
- Do a test buld and test the production-ready app locally or on a test server.

### 1.1.3 Automatic Optimization

There are 2 ways of deployment. These are,

#### Standard Build
- **npm run build** command to build the production files which will initiate **next build** as per stated in **package.json**.
- Produces optimized production bundles and a server-side app. Requires NodeJS server.
- Pages are pre-rendered (if possible), but NodeJS server is required for API routes, server-side pages and page revalidations.
- Re-deployment needed if code changes or you don't use revalidations and need page updates.

For this specific case, once we run "npm run build" command, the output down on the bottom is displayed.

λ  (Server)  server-side renders at runtime (uses getInitialProps or getServerSideProps)
○  (Static)  automatically rendered as static HTML (uses no initial props)
●  (SSG)     automatically generated as static HTML + JSON (uses getStaticProps)
   (ISR)     incremental static regeneration (uses revalidate in getStaticProps)
```

The console output above normally highlighted "355kb" with red in the actual Linux terminal. This is an indication that we might have heavy dependencies installed for the post details page. We can still deploy that but it is a clearly indication that the situation is not optimal.
```
/posts/[slug]                                              284 kB          355 kB
```

Much lighter versions of codes can be used inside PostContent.js.

#### Full Static Build
- **next export** command. This has to be added to the **"scripts"** section of the **package.json**. The entry should be written as **"export": "next export"**.
- Produces 100% static app (HTML, CSS, JS): No NodeJS server required.
- Does not work if your app uses API routes, server-side pages or wants to use page revalidations.
- Re-deployment needed for all code and content changes.

### 1.1.4 Deployment
- Once **npm run build** is conducted to create production files under **./.next** folder, we can run **npm start** to see how the production server will behave like.
- Deployment can be done using Vercel. For NextJS apps, Vercel is a good choice.

## 1.2 Other Deployment Notes Specific to this Project
If you are using npm package, use the following instructions:
- Create **.env.local** file to the root directory of the project. The only environmental variable for the file is **MONGODB_ATLAS_LINK**. Once the database is created, you have to find the link to "Connect your application". Then add it into the .env.local file. An example of the content of env.local file is given down below.

For more information you can refer to [MongoDB Atlas Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/getting-started/).

```
MONGODB_ATLAS_LINK=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@some-blog.8hxik6m.mongodb.net/<databaseName>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

Alternatively, you can use **next.config.js** to store environmental variables. The file has to be created on root directory of the project. Then the content should be like,

```javascript
// Environmental-Variable-Storing-in-next.config.js-File

// Used if we use the export command
// const { PHASE_EXPORT } = require('next/constants');

// Used if we run 'npm run dev'
const { PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER} = require('next/constants');

// Used if we run 'npm run build'
// const { PHASE_PRODUCTION_BUILD } = require('next/constants');

// Used after we build, for the server side code once our server is up and running
const { PHASE_PRODUCTION_SERVER } = require('next/constants');

module.exports = (phase) => {
    if (phase === PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER) {
        return {
            env: {
                mongodb_username: 'testName',
                mongodb_password: 'testPassword',
                mongodb_clustername: 'testCluster',
                mongodb_database: 'testDatabase'
            }
        };
    }

    return {
        env: {
            mongodb_username: 'aras',
            mongodb_password: 'realPassword',
            mongodb_clustername: 'realCluster',
            mongodb_database: 'realDatabase'
        }
    };
};
```

After that you can use it in a component file like

```javascript
    const nextConfigJsEnvVariables = `${process.env.mongodb_username}${process.env.mongodb_password}${process.env.mongodb_clustername}${process.env.mongodb_database}`;
```

- Run **npm i** to install dependencies.

- Run **npm run build** to optimize the project for production.

- Once the environmental variable is created, run **npm start** to start the server.

- If you are in development environment, do not forget to restart server once you create the .env.local file.

## 1.3 Keywords
### Markdown-To-HTML
### Read-from-Markdown-Convert-HTML
The npm package name to read from an md file and convert it to an HTML is **react-markdown**. Make sure to install version 5.0.3. **npm i react-markdown@5.0.3**
### Read-from-Markdown-Split-Metadata-and-Actual-Markdown-Content
The npm package to do it is **gray-matter**.
### Gray-Matter-Custom-Renderers-to-Use-Image-Component-of-NextJS
As stated in the keyword, if we search we can see gray-matter npm library has a property for ReactMarkdown component to pass Image component of NextJS so that we don't use classic image tag of HTML for better optimization.
### react-syntax-higlighter-Code-Snippet-Styling
react-syntax-higlighter npm library is useful if you have a code snippet in your markdown file. The react-syntax-higlighter npm library will be used to style the code snippet when it is transformed into html.
